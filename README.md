Created a Flutter shopping app with advanced functionalities, including a robust search system and the ability to add favorites. Leveraging Multiproviders for effective state management, the app offers a seamless user experience. It's powered by the Platzi Fake Store API, ensuring a wide range of products and real-time data for users, all wrapped in a sleek and user-friendly UI.
